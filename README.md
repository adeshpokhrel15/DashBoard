# DashBoard
## E Commerce Dashboard: <br>
A dashboard where manage all the products of a E commerce company. It is just a simple and basic project. We make API in Node JS. We make front end in React. Same API will work in both technology. We test the API using POSTMAN. 
We get to know how to integrate Node with Frontend. How to make basic project structure. How to manage multiple API.  How we can pass data one API to another API. 
We use Mongo-DB as a database. Even databases donâ€™t make an impact on frontend. Every API will fetch data from database.
